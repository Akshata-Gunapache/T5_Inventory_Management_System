## MODULES
The Inventory Management System is divided into several modules, each serving a specific function to ensure a well-organized and efficient system.<br>
### Module 1: User Authentication<br>
This module handles user authentication, allowing only authorized personnel to access the system. It includes login functionality, password protection, and access control for both admin and staff users.
Implementation: PHP sessions are used to manage user login status. Passwords are securely hashed and stored in the database. Access control is implemented to restrict functionalities based on user roles.
### Module 2: Product Management<br>
This module enables the addition, deletion, and modification of product details. It includes forms for entering product information such as name, description, price, and quantity.<br>
Implementation: PHP scripts handle CRUD operations. HTML forms collect user input and interact with the MySQL database to update or retrieve product details.
### Module 3: Inventory Tracking<br>
Real-time monitoring of stock levels is crucial for effective inventory management. This module tracks stock levels and sends alerts when the stock falls below a predefined threshold.
Implementation: PHP scripts regularly query the database for stock levels. Email notifications are triggered when stock reaches a critical level.
### Module 4: Order Processing<br>
This module manages customer orders, generates invoices, and updates stock levels accordingly. It includes functionalities for creating new orders, viewing order history, and generating invoices.
Implementation: PHP scripts handle the processing of orders. Database updates are made to reflect changes in stock levels and order history.
### Module 5: Reporting<br>
Reporting is essential for business analysis. This module generates various reports such as sales reports, stock levels, and order history.
Implementation: PHP scripts retrieve relevant data from the database and format it into reports. HTML and CSS are used to present the reports in a user-friendly manner.
### Module 6: User Management<br>
Admin privileges are necessary for managing user accounts. This module allows the admin to add, modify, or delete user accounts.
Implementation: PHP scripts implement CRUD operations for user accounts. Access controls ensure that only the admin can access user management functionalities.
